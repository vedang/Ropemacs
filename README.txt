 ropemacs, rope in emacs
=========================

Ropemacs is an emacs mode that uses rope_ library to provide features
like refactorings and code-assists.  You should install rope_ library
and Pymacs before using ropemacs.

Setting Up
==========

You can get Pymacs from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs/.
But version 0.22 does not work with Python 2.5 because of the lack of
file encoding declarations.  A simple patch is included:
``docs/pymacs_python25.patch``.

After installing pymacs, add these lines to your ``~/.emacs`` file::

  (require 'pymacs)
  (pymacs-load "ropemacs" "rope-")
  (rope-init)

Rope registers its local keys using ``python-mode`` hook.  If you
don't want to use rope with ``python-mode`` you can add
``rope-register-local-keys`` lisp function to some other hook.

If you want to load ropemacs only when you really need it, you can use
a function like this instead of that::

  (defun load-ropemacs ()
    "Load pymacs and ropemacs"
    (interactive)
    (require 'pymacs)
    (pymacs-load "ropemacs" "rope-")
    (rope-init)
    (setq rope-confirm-saving 'nil)
  )

And execute ``load-ropemacs`` whenever you want to use ropemacs.  Also
if you don't want to install rope library and ropemacs you can put
them somewhere and add them to the ``PYTHONPATH`` before loading
ropemacs in your ``.emacs``::

  (setenv "PYTHONPATH" (concat (getenv "PYTHONPATH")
                               ":/path/to/extracted/rope/package"
                               ":/path/to/extracted/ropemacs/package"))


Getting Started
===============

Rope refactorings use a special kind of dialog.  When you start a
refactoring, you'll be asked to confirm saving modified python
buffers; you can change it by using ``rope-confirm-saving`` variable.
Adding ``(setq rope-confirm-saving 'nil)`` to your ``.emacs`` file,
will make emacs save them without asking.

After that depending on the refactoring, you'll be asked about the
essential information a refactoring needs to know (like the new name
in rename refactoring).

Next you'll see the base prompt of a refactoring dialog that shows
something like "Choose what to do".  You can choose to set other
optional refactoring options; after setting each option you'll be
returned back to the base prompt.  Finally, you can ask rope to
perform, preview or cancel the refactoring.

See keybinding_ section and try the refactorings yourself.


Finding Files
-------------

By using ``rope-find-file`` (``C-x p f`` by default), you can search
for files in your project.  When you complete the minibuffer you'll
see all files in the project; files are shown as their reversed paths.
For instance ``projectroot/docs/todo.txt`` is shown like
``todo.txt<docs``.  This way you can find files faster in your
project.


Code-Assist
-----------

``rope-code-assist`` (``M-/`` by default) function will let you select
from a list of completions.  By giving this function an argument, you
can select which proposal to use without prompting; ``C-u 1 M-/`` uses
the second, for instance.

The ``rope-lucky-assist`` (``M-?``) is exactly like ``C-u 0 M-/``.  It
applies the first completion without asking.



Keybinding
----------

Uses almost the same keybinding as ropeide.

Variables
---------

* ``rope-confirm-saving``: If non-nil, you have to confirm saving all
  modified python files before refactorings; otherwise they are saved
  automatically. Defaults to ``t``.
